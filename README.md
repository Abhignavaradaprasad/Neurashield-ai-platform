# 🛡️ NeuraShield AI

## 🧠 Overview

**NeuraShield AI** is an AI-powered cybersecurity platform that delivers enterprise-grade security operations including real-time threat detection, automated response, predictive analytics, and 24/7 infrastructure monitoring. Designed to simulate a real-world SOC-as-a-Service solution, NeuraShield empowers businesses to defend against evolving threats efficiently using automation and intelligent design.
NeuraShield AI is a next-generation, AI-powered cybersecurity platform designed to defend modern enterprises against constantly evolving digital threats. Built as part of an advanced cybersecurity capstone, NeuraShield combines real-time detection, automated response, predictive intelligence, and continuous monitoring into a unified, intelligent security ecosystem.
At its core, NeuraShield is a Security Operations Center-as-a-Service (SOCaaS) that uses machine learning to detect, predict, and respond to threats with minimal human intervention — allowing organizations to stay ahead of attacks while reducing operational complexity and costs.

🔐 What Makes NeuraShield Unique?
✅ 1. AI-Driven Detection Engine
NeuraShield uses advanced machine learning models to analyze vast amounts of network and endpoint telemetry in real-time. It identifies anomalies that deviate from normal behavior and correlates them with global threat intelligence feeds to flag potential attacks — even if they're zero-day threats or fileless malware.
✅ 2. Automated Incident Response
Unlike traditional systems that rely on human action, NeuraShield includes built-in automation to isolate affected assets, block IPs, trigger alerts, and execute playbooks — drastically reducing mean time to respond (MTTR).
✅ 3. Predictive Threat Modeling
The platform leverages historical data to anticipate future threats. By feeding training data into the system, users can fine-tune detection sensitivity and simulate potential breaches before they occur.
✅ 4. Unified User Experience
NeuraShield offers a streamlined dashboard where users can:
Monitor alerts
Configure AI thresholds
Review threat summaries
Onboard new systems
Access threat intelligence
The interface is designed with usability and clarity in mind — reducing cognitive overload and ensuring fast decision-making in high-stress situations.
✅ 5. Scalable & Adaptable
Whether you're a small business or a large enterprise, NeuraShield adapts to your infrastructure. Its modular build allows easy integration with:
Firewalls (e.g., Palo Alto, Cisco)
IDS/IPS systems
Endpoint agents
Cloud providers (AWS, Azure)

This project was developed as part of my cybersecurity capstone to demonstrate practical, scalable security UX that meets modern enterprise needs.
